## What Is Recipe Buddy?
Introducing Gusteau, your personal recipe buddy!  Baking and cooking will never be the same again!  Gusteau is a voice-activated assistant that searches up recipes of your choosing, sorted based on time taken to make.  Upon selecting a desired recipe, Gusteau will check if you already have the ingredients in your Loblaw's Click & Collect cart.  If not, he searches the store for the highest recommended of the corresponding item and adds it to your cart.  Simple as pie!  Now, get cooking!

## How Was It Done?
Recipe Buddy was done using:
- Node.js/Google Cloud Functions for the server
- DialogFlow for the conversation management
- Google Assistant as the platform
- Yummly API for getting recipes and parsing ingredients
- Loblaw's Click & Collect API to get access to the user's cart

## Future Plans
1. Implement checkout straight from app
2. Allow sort options
3. Display amount of each item needed
4. Get recipe from items in cart
